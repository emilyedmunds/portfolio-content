        <h3> What is UPE looking for? </h3>
        <p> There’s no cookie cutter “ideal” rushee — if there were, Upsilon Pi Epsilon wouldn’t be the multi-talented, interdisciplinary organization that it is! In our experience, the qualities you’re looking for are often what we’d love to have in new members. In the end, we are an org united by our love for technology, and people who are truly passionate about tech are the ones who usually fit in the best.</p>
